# MIPS
MIPS simulator - ACA (CMSC 611)

### Objective
To experience the design issues of advanced computer architectures through the design of an analyzer for a
simplified MIPS CPU using high level programming languages. The considered MIPS CPU adopts the
CDC 6600 scoreboard scheme to dynamically schedule instruction execution and employ caches in order to
expedite memory access
